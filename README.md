# Starlit Epiphany
This is a NextJS app intended to help someone playing Legends of Runeterra predict what cards are most likely to be used against them at any given time. 

It is built on top of the starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn), and it will eventually incorporate the Riot Legends of Runeterra live game API to keep track of a game in progress. 

If you are interested in trying the current working version for yourself, install dependencies with ```npm install``` then run ```npm run dev``` and navigate to https://localhost:3000/starlit-epiphany

Features and design intentions are in TODO.md.
